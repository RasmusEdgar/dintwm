Note: Dintwm is most featureful as a commodity.

--------------------------------
Run from cli (or bind with Fkey)
--------------------------------

Place in your path or cd to dir. 

Keep dintwm executable and info together.

Examples:

With a gap for the workbench titlebar.

dintwm -g -u

With custom gaps all around:

dintwm -U 45 -B 45 -L 45 -R 45 -t

Set tiling to occur where ever you decide on the screen.

dintwm -U 320 -L 320 -t

Test commodity functionality with:

dintwm

or

dintwm -C

List available options with:

dintwm -h

----
TODO
----

* Implement dedicated dintwm screen
* Ensure AROS compatibility (works without bar)
